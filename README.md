# Logistic map

- logistic_map.c : This code calculates the values of the logistic map for a given set of parameters and writes them to a file. The logistic map is a simple nonlinear dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behavior for certain parameter values. The program uses a loop to iteratively calculate the values of the map and write them to a file.

- logistic_map_attractor.c: The code implements the logistic map and shows how to generate an attractor plot for a given parameter value of lambda and initial condition of x. The program calculates the next state of x using the logistic map equation and writes the current and next states to a file to plot the attractor. The program also writes the next state twice to plot a vertical line on the attractor plot.

- logistic_map_bifurcation.c: This code generates data for a bifurcation diagram of the logistic map. The logistic map is a mathematical equation that models the growth of a population over time. The equation takes into account the population size at any given time, and uses a parameter called "lambda" to determine the growth rate.

- logistic_map_comp.c : This program calculates and writes the values of the logistic map equation with a fixed lambda value of 3.1 and an initial value of $x_0=0.2$.
